    Welcome to Bored Builder, this is just a collection of some random code that
    I have written while I was feeling awfully bored. <br />
    This work is highly inspired by
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague">Sebastian Lague</a> and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">The Coding Train</a>.
